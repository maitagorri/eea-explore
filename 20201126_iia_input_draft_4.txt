0. General observations

In order to meet 2050 targets, the 50% reduction target in limit values is not sufficient. Increased ambition and leadership on the part of the EU, and commensurate adjustment of key instruments, are in order. As electrification progresses, *standards should be based on energy efficiency rather than tailpipe CO2 emissions*, in order to 1. address the imbalance between electric and combustion cars and 2. ensure that all vehicle types improve over time. Given the timeframe of this assessment, we suggest thorough revision of existing regulation, with particular consideration of the two following areas (among others).

I. Supplementary standards for ICEV given rising percentage of ZLEV

Rising shares of ZLEV in manufacturers’ fleets lead to rising allowable CO2 emission level for the remainder of the fleet (the ICEV), until, at some point, the fleet limit value no longer constrains emission levels of ICEV.[1] This effect can be controlled with supplementary limit values (LV) for ICEV in addition to a fleet LV curve.

To this end, we suggest implementing a *backstop LV curve* related to the existing one but applied to ICEV only.
- The advantage of this approach is its continuation of the established format of an LV curve 
- The curve could be determined in different ways, with distinct distributional impacts requiring further investigation. Examples include:
	- Multiplier applied to the existing LV curve, to meet 2021 average value for ICEV
	- Parallel shift of the existing LV curve, to meet 2021 average value for combustion cars
	- Trend curve based on ICEV registered in 2021

An alternative aproach could be a *manufacturer-specific backstop LV*, also based on the 2021 status quo. Either approach would provide relative resilience to manipulation of baseline values, since product plans for 2021 are largely finalized.

Moreover, the ZLEV incentive mechanism—in particular for PHEV, which often have higher real emissions than their lab results—should be abandoned: with EV becoming competitive on their own, such mechanisms may eventually slow down rather than accelerate market uptake.

II. Separate standards for fuels and vehicles

Some stakeholders have called for the inclusion of fuel credits in emissions standards. We strongly advise against this approach, for the following reasons:
- *Loss of efficacy* as a result of commingling regulatory spheres: fleet standards have had great success improving vehicle technology, while fuels would generally be regulated by energy legislation. Commingling regulation in both of these areas creates the risk of confining future improvements to just one of the two sectors 
	- Such overflow effects could include *adverse impacts* on 1. *fuel policy* (biofuels) or 2. the *achievement of ESR targets*
- *Higher costs*: where fleet standards on the whole reduce costs through lower fuel consumption over the lifetime of a vehicle, synthetic fuels would increase the cost to end consumers as well as society as a whole
- *Loss of transparency and credibility*: if ICE with compensatory synthetic fuel production are sold as ZLEV, especially if they receive related benefits, this is likely to further undermine consumer trust

We look forward to submitting more detailed inputs as the impact assessment proceeds.
